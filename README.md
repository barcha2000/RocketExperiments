# Master's Thesis Repository: Application of Convolution in Time Series Classification

This repository contains the source codes for the master's thesis titled **"Application of Convolution in Time Series Classification."** The thesis explores various convolution-based methods for classifying time series data.

## Repository Structure

This repository includes the following components:

1. **Rocket and MiniRocket Simulations**
   - This directory contains the implementation codes for the Rocket and MiniRocket simulations used in the thesis.

2. **S-Rocket Simulations**
   - The source code for the S-Rocket simulations is available in a separate repository. You can find it [here](https://github.com/barcha2000/srocket).

3. **InceptionTime Simulations**
   - The source code for the InceptionTime simulations is available in a separate repository. You can find it [here](https://github.com/barcha2000/InceptionTime).

4. **TimesNet Simulations**
   - The source code for the TimesNet simulations is available in a separate repository. You can find it [here](https://github.com/barcha2000/Time-Series-Library).

## Results

Performance metrics for each method are located in the `results` directory. The results are organized into subdirectories named after the respective datasets. Each file within these subdirectories follows the naming convention: `<dataset_name><classifier>.`

Example structure:

`results/ECG200/ECG200Bagging.csv`
